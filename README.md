# PageLinks

**TODO: Add description**

## Installation

If [available in Hex](https://hex.pm/docs/publish), the package can be installed
by adding `page_links` to your list of dependencies in `mix.exs`:

```elixir
def deps do
  [
    {:page_links, "~> 0.1.0"}
  ]
end
```

Documentation can be generated with [ExDoc](https://github.com/elixir-lang/ex_doc)
and published on [HexDocs](https://hexdocs.pm). Once published, the docs can
be found at [https://hexdocs.pm/page_links](https://hexdocs.pm/page_links).

## Running the code.
While running the code from source code, run ```mix deps.get``` followed by ```mix compile```. Now the code is compiled and ready to run. Open up a terminal/shell and run ```iex -S mix```. This will open up an Interactive Elixir Shell. In IEx, call ```PageLinks.fetch_url(<input_url>)``` which will display the output on the Shell.

### Note: 
This module was developed on Elixir 1.8.2
